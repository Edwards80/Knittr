# Knittr

An app for designing, editing, storing and viewing knitting patterns. It uses a grid based pattern entry system which is then parsed into written instructions, which are in the same format as a traditional knitting pattern.

The front end is built using react - the data is stored in a mongoDB and is provided by the Knittr back end app - ( https://github.com/Edwards80/Knittr-BE )
